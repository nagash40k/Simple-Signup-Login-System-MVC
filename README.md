# Simple Signup/Login System MVC

Simple Signup/Login System written in vanilla PHP in MVC model. 

## Future plans

I plan to develop this project in the near future. I will endeavor to finally make it a ready-to-use Login/Signup module that I will be able to use in other projects in my portfolio.
